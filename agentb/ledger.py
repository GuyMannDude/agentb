"""Memory Ledger — a tamper-evident chain over what the store was told.

v4.20.0. Every memory record has two halves. The TESTIMONY is what the
person or agent said: the summary, the key facts, the decisions, who said
it and when. The FILING is what the store did with it afterwards: category,
tags, superseded_by, reclassification marks. The filing is allowed to
change — the dreamer reclassifies, a later write supersedes. The testimony
is not. Once a memory is saved, its words must never silently become other
words.

The ledger seals the testimony. One append-only ``ledger.jsonl`` per tenant,
next to ``memory/``. Each entry carries the SHA-256 of the sealed fields,
the hash of the entry before it, and its own hash over the whole entry.
Change one record on disk and ``verify`` reports it ``altered``. Edit or
drop a ledger line and the chain reports ``broken`` at that sequence.
There is no way to rewrite the past without the rewrite showing.

Sealing is honest about its limits. It is local evidence, not third-party
proof: whoever can write the memory files can also rewrite the ledger from
scratch. What it catches is the ordinary disaster — a bad migration, a
half-finished script, a sync that mangled a file, a stick that carried
something the origin never wrote — and it catches it every time.

States a record can be in:

- ``sealed``   — on disk and its testimony matches its latest ledger entry
- ``altered``  — on disk, but the testimony differs from what was sealed
- ``missing``  — sealed, but the file is gone (memories are never deleted:
                 demotion keeps the JSON — a missing sealed file is news)
- ``unsealed`` — on disk with no ledger entry: pre-ledger stores, records
                 carried in by a Cortex Stick, or written by a tool that
                 bypassed the server. ``seal_unsealed`` adopts them.
- ``disputed`` — (broken chain only) on disk and matching an entry the
                 chain cannot vouch for. A hash chain cannot say WHICH of
                 two neighbours was rewritten, only that the link between
                 them broke — so everything from the break onward is
                 evidence, not proof. Matches → disputed; differs →
                 altered.

Chain states: ``intact`` / ``broken`` / ``empty``.

The idea is borrowed with credit from MAYA Memory Lane's sealed blocks
(SHA-256 fingerprints folding into a chain). Built here from zero to fit
Mnemo's per-record JSON store.
